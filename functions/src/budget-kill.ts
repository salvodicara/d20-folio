/**
 * budget-kill — the PURE decision logic behind the `onBudgetAlert` kill-switch
 * (SAFE-01, the zero-budget hard guarantee).
 *
 * The Cloud Function (`index.ts`) does the IO (decode the Pub/Sub message, read the
 * project's current billing state, detach the billing account via the Cloud Billing
 * API); these helpers hold the branchy, safety-relevant DECISION so it can be
 * unit-tested WITHOUT any Google Cloud call (mirroring how `issue-format.ts` /
 * `owner-digest.ts` / `delete-user-plan.ts` keep their logic pure). No Firebase / no
 * Cloud imports.
 *
 * The doctrine (Google's documented "disable billing to stop usage" pattern): a
 * Cloud Billing budget publishes a JSON notification to a Pub/Sub topic; when the
 * ACTUAL accumulated cost exceeds the budget amount we detach billing to force spend
 * to zero. We act ONLY on real cost overrun — never on a forecast. The forecast
 * alert still carries the ACTUAL `costAmount`, so comparing `costAmount > budgetAmount`
 * naturally ignores forecast thresholds (a forecast can trip while actual cost is
 * still under budget → no action).
 */

/**
 * The subset of the Cloud Billing budget Pub/Sub notification payload we reason over
 * (schema version "1.0"). The budget publishes more fields (`currencyCode`,
 * `costIntervalStart`, threshold-exceeded markers); we only need the two amounts plus
 * the display name for logging. All fields are optional — a malformed/partial payload
 * must resolve to "no action", never crash.
